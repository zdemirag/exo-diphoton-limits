00.01.13
 - updated setup scripts for standalone, CMSSW,
   cmslpc standalone, lxplus standalone
 - added standard bayesian MCMC interval routine (root/cms_stat_001.C)
   and a test macro for it (root/examples/cms_test_001.C)

V00-01-12
 - added plot format config option to all calculators

 - added Feldman-Cousins calculator

 - added Profile Likelihood calculator

 - BayesianCalculator: model_config option is added, now
   arbitrary named model configs can be specified

V00-01-11
 - fixed bug with dataset weights, now weights seem to work

V00-01-10
 - Workarounds introduced to accomodate CMSSW environment

 - Test case: zprime.cfg updated to do a single channel MCMC limit calculation

 - added an optional 'name' field to the ModelConfig
   section (defines the name of the Model Config object)

 - fully integrated Markov Chain Monte Carlo interval calculator (MCMC):
   - Mandatory parameters:
       action_name = mcmc
       model_config
       data
   - optional parameters:
       ph_cache_size
       confidence_level
       left_side_tail_fraction
       burn_in_steps
       number_of_iterations
       make_posterior_plot

V00-01-09
 - fixed a configuration bug for CMSSW-based setup on cmslpc

V00-01-08
 - added python-like syntax for the [Data] section of the config

 - added combine() method to the [Data] section, for combining datasets,
   this is useful for simultaneous PDFs used for channel combination

 - updated config file examples

 - incorporated environment setup in the application script. User only
   needds to set ROOTSYS.

 - added two special cases for the environment setup: cmslpc and lxplus
   The application now recognizes when it is run on these machines
   and sets up the environment, assuming that CMSSW environment was set
   by the user

V00-01-07
 - added exostConfig.is_var_in_ws() to check if
   a variable is in the workspace
   (usually this is checked by ws.var()!=None
   but it doesn't always work, some PyROOT quirk)
   This was needed for getting weights from input

V00-01-04
 - added output verbosity flag as command line parameter

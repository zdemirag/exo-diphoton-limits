- make sure that categories can be defined

- workdir for each process

- add option for multiple ModelConfigs

- integrate profileLL

- integrate hybrid

- integrate Feldman-Cousins

- check/enforce fix/float consistency

- add the fit action

- add random names to temp HLFactory card files

- load data from ASCII
   - binned (hist)
   + unbinned *DONE*

- generate data from PDFs

- why the names in the data section(?) case-insensitive?

- add compilable custom RooAbsPdfs (without gROOT.ProcessLine)
   idea: if an unknown PDF, check for the .cxx and .h files with the same name, compile and import if present

- include external actions (from separate macros?)

- check existance of the ModelConfig before accessing it

- check existance of the Bayes calculator before accessing it

- add RooFormulaVar support for RooDataSet weights from TTree (currently, just var)

- add file name option for bayesian posterior plot

- check that object is present in the input data file

- add timing for actions

- add PDF shape fitting

- fix: TMath::Exp() screws up function's name when used with cexpr

- use standard set interface from RooFactoryWSTool
